# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying computer science in media (also called media informatics) at [HFU](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/).
I like to do a lot of different things, but some of my bigger interests lie in the development for native desktop apps, graphics and AI.

## What is media informatics?

If you don't know what media informatics is about, this is one of the better descriptions:

> â€žMedia informatics deals with all aspects of digital media and information technology, with a particularly strong interest in the interaction of humans with computers. Media informatics may be best described as an applied computer science with a strong focus on the design and implementation of software systems. Such systems are, however, not only designed from a functional engineering perspective, but also in a way to ensure an optimal human-computer interaction.â€œ [Â¹](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/language-literature-culture/media-informatics/home/index.html)
